This project has a greater goal of being the logic for an API that can return the available moves of a team, given a current game state.

- The purpose of this API is to be able to create a web-based chess game with minimal logic required on the front-end to be able to play.

<br>
This project also has a greater goal of creating a chessbot/AI, which can also have an API endpoint to return a gameboard with the best possible move already performed.
